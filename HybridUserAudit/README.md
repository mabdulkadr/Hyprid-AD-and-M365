## Overview

**HybridUserAudit** is a PowerShell script designed to generate a comprehensive user report across a hybrid environment consisting of on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). It merges attributes from both sources, tracks login activity, and produces a CSV report for auditing, compliance, or inventory purposes.

- 📅 Includes key user attributes (display name, email, creation date, last logon, etc.)
- 🔁 Real-time progress in the PowerShell console
- 💾 Exports a UTF-8 encoded CSV report to `C:\Reports`
- 📓 Generates a detailed log file
- 🧪 Optimized for large environments (100K+ users)
- 🔐 Uses Microsoft Graph API for secure cloud data access
